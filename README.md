## Bugs
There are still some bugs that i have found solutions for them such as
<ul>
<li>Changing song's progress by dragging the bar instead of clicking make the background color go wrong.</li>
<li>Clicking on the first song of Random list when the web is loaded will not play that song</li>
I will try to fix them in the near future. Any suggestion will be appreciated!
